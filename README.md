# Snappdeal-project
📌 Project Overview
Designed and implemented a production‑grade, scalable cloud architecture for a containerized eCommerce platform on AWS. Built a complete CI/CD pipeline integrated with Amazon ECR and deployed the application on a Kubernetes cluster with automated scaling, secure secret management, and self‑managed stateful services.

Replaced managed database and cache services with containerized PostgreSQL 17 and Redis 6.2 while maintaining high availability and performance.
